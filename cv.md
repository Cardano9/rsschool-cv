3. * __Summary__
      *   _My main goal is to make the world brighter 
so that people are kinder to each other, ready to help 
in difficult times. But for all this, people need to 
deal more with themselves, read books, attend conferences. 
In my opinion, training in any profession should be free, that's why 
I went to programming in order to further implement the platform, for free knowledge._
